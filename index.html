    <h2>The Best Three Movies According to Oladipo</h2>
    <h3>My top 3 moviesof all-time.</h3>
    <hr />

    <h3>Game of Throne</h3>
    <p>The film was about power pursuit. <br />wind broken by mountains, mountains cut by rivers
    man is but only flesh and bones
    for every caesar lurks behind a brutus
    welcome to the game of thrones!</p>
    <h3>Afemuna</h3>
    <p>The film show cases the life of an intern. The movie Afamefuna gets its theme from its name.<br /> Afamefuna, meaning my name will not be lost, stands for longevity; respect and reverence for age-old traditions that make a manâ€™s name or a particular <br />custom transcend and flourish despite the barriers of time.</p>
    <h3>She must Be Obeyed</h3>
    <p>The film shows how childhood traumas can mold behaviours. <br /> In a world where musical films are still a rarity in Nollywood, Funke Akindele's "SHE Must Be Obeyed" emerges as a daring!</p>
